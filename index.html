    <h1>Pat's Salmon Cookies: Our Story</h1>
    <aritcle>
      <section>
      <p>When our founder, Pat, baked the first batch of salmon cookies, he knew he had a hit on his hands. These sweet sea treats have that perfect briny flavor, and all the Omega 3s that your brain needs to do its best work. It wasn't long before these modern Puget Sound classics swept their way out of Seattle to worldwide franchise locations in five countries -- and counting!</p>
